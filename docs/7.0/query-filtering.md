# Query Filtering

## Query Filters

You can restrict [extract methods](/7.0/reading/) and [conversion methods](/7.0/converting/) output by setting query options. To set those options you will need to use the methods described below. But keep in mind that:

- The query options methods are all chainable *except when they have to return a boolean*;
- The query options methods can be call in any sort of order before any extract/conversion method;
- After an extract/conversion method call, all query options are cleared;
- The optional extract method callable function is called after all query options have been applied;

<p class="message-info">The options methods are described in the same order as they are applied on the CSV iterator. The order is similar to one found in SQL statement construct.</p>

<p class="message-notice">Starting with <code>version 7.0</code> The query options can be use to modify the output from the <code>jsonSerialize</code>, <code>toXML</code> and <code>toHTML</code> methods.</p>

<p class="message-notice">Starting with <code>version 7.1</code> The query options are also available for conversion methods on the <code>League\Csv\Writer</code> class.</p>

## Modifying content methods

### stripBOM($status)

<p class="message-notice">Introduced in version <code>7.1</code></p>

`stripBom` only argument `$status` must be a `boolean`. This method specifies if the [BOM sequence](/7.0/bom/) must be removed or not from the CSV's first cell of the first row. The actual stripping will take place only if a BOM sequence is detected and the first row is selected in the resultset **or** if its offset is used as the first argument of the `Reader::fetchAssoc` method.

<p class="message-info">For backward compatibility, if the method is not called no BOM sequence will be stripped from the CSV document.</p>

<p class="message-warning">The BOM sequence is never removed from the CSV document, it is only stripped from the resultset.</p>

## Filtering methods

The filtering options **are the first settings applied to the CSV before anything else**. The filters follow the *First In First Out* rule.

### addFilter(callable $callable)

The `addFilter` method adds a callable filter function each time it is called. The function can take up to three parameters:

- the current csv row data;
- the current csv key;
- the current csv iterator object;

### removeFilter(callable $callable)

`removeFilter` method removes an already registered filter function. If the function was registered multiple times, you will have to call `removeFilter` as often as the filter was registered. **The first registered copy will be the first to be removed.**

### hasFilter(callable $callable)

`hasFilter` method checks if the filter function is already registered

### clearFilter()

`clearFilter` method removes all registered filter functions.

## Sorting methods

The sorting options are applied **after the CSV filtering options**. The sorting follow the *First In First Out* rule.

<p class="message-warning">To sort the data <code>iterator_to_array</code> is used which could lead to performance penalty if you have a heavy CSV file to sort
</p>

### addSortBy(callable $callable)

`addSortBy` method adds a sorting function each time it is called. The function takes exactly two parameters which will be filled by pairs of rows.

### removeSortBy(callable $callable)

`removeSortBy` method removes an already registered sorting function. If the function was registered multiple times, you will have to call `removeSortBy` as often as the function was registered. **The first registered copy will be the first to be removed.**

### hasSortBy(callable $callable)

`hasSortBy` method checks if the sorting function is already registered

### clearSortBy()

`clearSortBy` method removes all registered sorting functions.

## Interval methods

The methods enable returning a specific interval of CSV rows. When called more than once, only the last filtering settings is taken into account. The interval is calculated **after filtering and/or sorting but before extracting the data**.

### setOffset($offset = 0)

`setOffset` method specifies an optional offset for the return data. By default the offset equals `0`.

### setLimit($limit = -1)

`setLimit` method specifies an optional maximum rows count for the return data. By default the offset equals `-1`, which translate to all rows.

<p class="message-warning">Both methods have no effect on the <code>fetchOne</code> method output.</p>

## Examples

### Modifying extract methods output

Here's an example on how to use the query features of the `Reader` class to restrict the `fetchAssoc` result:

```php
function filterByEmail($row)
{
    return filter_var($row[2], FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL);
}

function sortByLastName($rowA, $rowB)
{
    return strcmp($rowB[1], $rowA[1]);
}

$data = $reader
    ->stripBom(false)
    ->setOffset(3)
    ->setLimit(2)
    ->addFilter('filterByEmail')
    ->addSortBy('sortByLastName')
    ->fetchAssoc(['firstname', 'lastname', 'email'], function ($value) {
    return array_map('strtoupper', $value);
});
// data length will be equals or lesser that 2 starting from the row index 3.
// will return something like this :
//
// [
//   ['firstname' => 'JANE', 'lastname' => 'RAMANOV', 'email' => 'JANE.RAMANOV@EXAMPLE.COM'],
//   ['firstname' => 'JOHN', 'lastname' => 'DOE', 'email' => 'JOHN.DOE@EXAMPLE.COM'],
// ]
//
```

### Modifying conversion methods output

Starting with `version 7.0`, the query options can also modify the output from the conversion methods as shown below with the `toHTML` method.

```php
function filterByEmail($row)
{
    return filter_var($row[2], FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL);
}

function sortByLastName($rowA, $rowB)
{
    return strcmp($rowB[1], $rowA[1]);
}

$data = $reader
    ->stripBom(true)
    ->setOffset(3)
    ->setLimit(2)
    ->addFilter('filterByEmail')
    ->addSortBy('sortByLastName')
    ->toHTML("simple-table");
// $data contains the HTML table code equivalent to:
//
//<table class="simple-table">
//  <tr><td>JANE</td><td>RAMANOV</td><td>JANE.RAMANOV@EXAMPLE.COM</td></tr>
//  <tr><td>JOHN</td><td>DOE</td><td>JOHN.DOE@EXAMPLE.COM</td></tr>
//</table>
//
```
