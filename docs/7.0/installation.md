# Installation

## System Requirements

You need **PHP >= 5.4.0** or **HHVM >= 3.2** and the `mbstring` extension to use `League\Csv` but the latest stable version of PHP/HHVM is recommended.

## Composer

`League\Csv` is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/league/csv) and can be installed using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

~~~
composer require league/csv:^7.0
~~~

## Going Solo

You can also use `League\Csv` without using Composer by downloading the library and using any other [PSR-4](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) compatible autoloader.
